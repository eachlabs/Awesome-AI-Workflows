# AI Flow Execution Inputs

This document provides explanations for the execution inputs used in your AI model.

## Inputs

### 1. `face`
- **Type:** String
- **Title:** Face Image
- **Component:** File

**Description:** This input represents an image file of a face that the model will process. The file should contain the face that the model will analyze and operate on. Supported file formats include `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.

### 2. `input_audio`
- **Type:** String
- **Title:** Input Audio
- **Component:** File

**Description:** This input represents an audio file that the model will process. The audio file should contain the sound that the model will synchronize or analyze. Supported file formats include `.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.


## Usage

These inputs are required parameters for running the model. Providing complete and accurate inputs ensures that the model operates correctly and yields expected results.

- **Face Image**: Upload the face image file.
- **Input Audio**: Upload the audio file.

When these inputs are provided, the model will process the uploaded face image and audio file to perform the specified tasks.
